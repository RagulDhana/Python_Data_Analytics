US_Motor_Vehicle_collision_Report
This dashboard, titled US Vehicle Motor Collision Report 2019-2023, provides a comprehensive univariate and bivariate analysis of vehicle crash data to identify key trends and contributing factors.

📌 Executive Summary

Human Factor Dominance: Analysis reveals that human factors are overwhelmingly the primary contributor to crashes, accounting for 87.4% of incidents.




High-Risk Vehicle Types: Passenger or Suburban vehicles and 4-Door Sedans are the most common body types involved in collisions.



Regional Concentration: The dataset indicates a heavy concentration of incidents in New York, which may suggest a regional focus in the data collection.



Primary Incident Type: The most frequent action prior to an accident is "Going Straight Ahead," accounting for over 2,000 incidents.


📊 Key Visualizations & Insights
1. Vehicle & Registration Trends

Body Type Distribution: Suburban vehicles and 4-Door Sedans show significantly higher involvement in crashes compared to all other categories.


Registration Class: The "Passenger or Suburban" class is the most frequently involved, followed by "Commercial" and "Omnibuses".

2. Contributing Factors

Categorical Breakdown: Beyond human factors, environmental issues are the second most common factor at 11.3%.



Top Specific Factor: Surprisingly, "Animal's Action" is the single most cited specific contributing factor, with 367 incidents.



Event Types: The most frequent event leading to an accident is a collision with another motor vehicle, followed by collisions with fixed objects like trees and utility poles.


3. Temporal & Correlation Analysis

Yearly Trends: Recorded crashes peaked in 2019. A declining trend is noted through 2023, though this may be due to data sampling completeness rather than a true reduction in accidents.





Correlations: There is a strong positive correlation between the Year of the crash and the Vehicle Year, suggesting newer vehicles are naturally involved in more recent recorded incidents.


🛠️ Technical Components

Tools Used: Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn) integrated into Power BI.



Analysis Types:


Univariate: Distribution of body types, registration classes, and incident types.


Bivariate/Multivariate: Trends of contributing factors over years and regional comparisons.**
